When Willie shut the library, we walked over to Jock’s Charcoal Chicken.

 Jock, was *really*, Josip. His parents came over from Croatia, and started the shop in the 80's, but it’s been Jock behind the counter as long as I can remember. He smiled every time we came in, and shouted our usual order at us before we sat down.  
"Two handbags, chips and 'slaw boys?"  
“*Yes*,” we chorused, taking a can of Fanta and Solo from the display fridge, dropping into the plastic chairs, and thunking the cold cans onto the rickety metal table, kept kinda level by some serviettes tucked under its wonky leg.  

Jock was somewhere between 25 and 45 years old. He had crow’s feet, and deep wrinkles in his forehead, but you hardly noticed 'cos he was always smiling.

His sister Ena had been the year above us at school. She was friendly, and cute, and I'd stood next to her at many a Monday assembly, brought in front of the beige mass that was Miles High student body - God knows who chose that uniform colour scheme - as the principal congratulated us both on our weekend feats; me for a high score at whatever cricket fixture, and Ena for the maths and science compeittions she was perpetually entering, and often winning.  

Whenever we were driving back to Miles from an away game, Dad asking me what I wanted to eat for dinner, it was alway's chicjen from Jock's. Rohan and I started going there ourselves soon as pocket money came into our lives. With my mate or my old man, whenever Ena was working, she'd always packed into the paper wrap chip box, a handful more chips than Jock ever did. Not that Jock skimped; it was just, Ena giving extra.  

I asked her to my final year formal, but she'd been taking her first exams on her full scholarship economics degree at Queensland Uni. She couldn't come, and nowadays, she's hardly in Miles. But as I daydream about her curly brown hair, holding my can of fanta tight as if it were her hand, think I catch a whiff of that cheap every-girl priceline perfume, amidst the heavy opressive chicken scent  

Then Jock hollering at the top of his lungs brings me back.  

mal that year, but she had exams up in  
and would give us an extra handful of chips  

this was back before loyalty cards and stamps became all the rage.  

was a few years older than us,  used to work here. She’d been cute, but she moved to Brisbane, doing some business degree at Uni. Now, every day and night, seven days a week, it’s just Jock and the hot, rotating chicken spits.  

But Jock was a professional, and in just ten minutes, our plastic see-through carry bags of steamy, rotisserie chicken, chips already going soggy, and side containers of 'slaw, were ready. We said thanks, jingled the door chimes on our way out, and took the short walk from the Miles main drag, down to Dogwood Creek  

It'd once been a river, Dogwood Creek. Now, there’s just enough water trickling by to wash your hands with after eating. The air was still warm, and the waning sunset gave enough light to see what we were doing. We sat on the old, dead, driftwood, by the dry, once-a-river edge.  

The only sounds were our slurping mouths around chicken bones, us munch-crunching our 'slaw dipped chips, and a few magpies  in a nearby tree, singing their mating calls. We threw the chicken bones at their tree, and washed our hands in the trickling water.  

We walked back from where we'd come, across the side streets and up the main drag, to the third and final stop of our every Wednesday routine: The Farris Hotel pool tournament.
